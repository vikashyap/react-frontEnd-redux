* Consume our public API @ https://api.mcmakler.de/v1/advertisements to retrieve a list of advertisements of vacant apartments.
* Display the first 10 advertisements in the HTML + CSS layout created in step A, sticking to the layout, placing data where it fits.
* **NOTE:** You are free to use any framework you wish, or do it VanillaJS style. *Brief explanation of your choice.*



## Check Points
* Consumed public API @ https://api.mcmakler.de/v1/advertisements to retrieve
  a list of advertisements of vacant apartments,but not able to find api filters for example. Didn't get any information about meta data which includes page, pageSize and count. Thats why when i am hitting the given api,
  I am getting whole 700 results in my request.Though i am getting whole data, so i thought to implement client side pagination in my App, bit extra work for me but i wanted to be justify with whole data.


* Test cases are written in Jest suit and Enzymes, which are most prefarable 
  suit with React Applications.
* I tried to implement Git hooks but not able push .git folder in repo, for
  now i used npm pre-commit hook which checks linting before any git commit.
